Rest Hooks is a library for fetching structured data in a performant way with no boilerplate.

Its interface is declarative and minimal. A small structure declaration is all that is needed
for Rest Hooks to perform numerous fetching and caching optimizations while providing predictable,
precisely-typed data to consume.

Structured data means data composed of [Objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)
([maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array))
and [Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)
([lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_(abstract_data_type))), as opposed to media
like images and videos. This makes it great for API calls regardless of form ([REST-like](https://restfulapi.net/),
[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), [gRPC](https://grpc.io/)), serialization ([JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON), [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML)),
or transport ([HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview), [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API), [local](../guides/mocking-unfinished)).
